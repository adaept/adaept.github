The original source for

is adapted to suit the needs of this work.
 
 Command line tools have already been installed through following the [GettingStarted] guide.
 `tsc` a TypeScript compiler, `tsd` a TypeScript definition manager, and `http-server`
 a simple server which used to view the app. `Visual Code` is the editor.
